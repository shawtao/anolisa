//! `anolisa enable` — capability activation.
//!
//! P1-F wiring: dry-run path still goes through [`anolisa_core::plan_enable`]
//! and renders the resulting [`EnablePlan`] (human or JSON). On the
//! non-dry-run path the handler now drives the real-execute orchestrator
//! [`anolisa_core::execute_enable`]: download artifact → install ANOLISA-owned
//! files → write `InstalledState` capability/component objects → append
//! `started` / `succeeded` records to `CentralLog` → release the
//! [`anolisa_core::InstallLock`]. Any mid-flight failure self-cleans (unlinks files,
//! appends a `Failed` record, releases the lock).
//!
//! Scope limits enforced here (rather than inside the planner / executor)
//! so the underlying libraries stay general while the CLI surface honors
//! the launch-spec scope:
//!
//! * Exactly one capability per invocation.
//! * `--feature`, `--with-adapter`, `--from-source` are not supported on
//!   either path yet; we reject explicitly so users see a clear contract
//!   rather than silently-ignored flags.
//! * Both `--dry-run` and real-execute are scoped by the declarative
//!   execution policy at [`crate::execution_policy`]
//!   (`templates/execution-policy.toml`). Up through P1-G1 this gate was a
//!   hard-coded `SUPPORTED_CAPABILITY = "agent-observability"` constant;
//!   P1-H replaces it with the policy file so a second capability
//!   (`token-optimization`) can graduate without touching Rust. Capabilities
//!   absent from the policy — or present with `allow_execute = false` —
//!   continue to surface `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` so the boundary is visible.
